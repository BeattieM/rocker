Ruby and React on Docker

## Purpose
The initial purpose of this project is to be a tool to teach myself React as well as expand my knowledge of Docker. As such it will follow one of the most common ideas for a tutorial project: a Twitter clone.

## Assumption of Technologies
As I only have the most basic of understanding for the React development environment most of my tool choices are being made based off of the various tutorials I will be reading as well as the [react-slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) repository.
